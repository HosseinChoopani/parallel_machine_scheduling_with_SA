# parallel_machine_scheduling_with_SA
Solving parallel machines scheduling problem using Simulated Annealing (SA) meta-heuristic algorithm, applied in MATLAB 2013a

The main simulated annealing algorithm is in PMS_SA_rndINPT.m file while two other files are functions.
More information about this code will be added soon.
